# Presentation layer

This directory contains the presentation layer of the application.
It is written in JavaScript using the React framework.
For development, the application can be deployed in a NodeJS Express
server that provides debugging facilities.
In production, the application can be deployed on an arbitrary server
that serves static content. The provided docker image uses Nginx.

The JavaScript presentation layer en-/decodes gRPC payloads using the
JS stubs generated by `protoc` and submits them to the back-end application
through an Envoy proxy that provides an HTTP/1.1 to gRPC bridge.
